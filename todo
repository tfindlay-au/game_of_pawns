I won't be able to do this, but:

[x] Board should be owned by board module.
[ ] I'd like to move parsing of args into get_mode() function, but rust is hard.
[x] Write assumptions (distance between kings, parsing of args).
[x] Move pieces into constants. And use them everywhere instead of chars. They should belong to pieces module.
[ ] Generator is a function, it can be injected into pieces and board modules to make them deterministic.
